# sanity-php

PHP library for the [Sanity API](https://sanity.io/)

[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/sanity/sanity-php.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/sanity/sanity-php)[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/sanity-io/sanity-php.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/sanity-io/sanity-php)

## Requirements

sanity-php requires PHP >= 5.6, with the `json` module installed.

## Composer

You can install the library via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```bash
composer require sanity/sanity-php
```

To use the library, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Usage

### Instantiating a new client

```php
use Sanity\Client as SanityClient;

$client = new SanityClient([
  'projectId' => 'your-project-id',
  'dataset' => 'your-dataset-name',
  // Whether or not to use the API CDN for queries. Default is false.
  'useCdn' => true,
  // If you are starting a new project, using the current UTC date is usually
  // a good idea. See "Specifying API version" section for more details
  'apiVersion' => '2019-01-29',
]);
```

### Using an authorization token

```php
$client = new SanityClient([
  'projectId' => 'your-project-id',
  'dataset' => 'your-dataset-name',
  'useCdn' => false,
  'apiVersion' => '2019-01-29',
  // Note that you cannot combine a token with the `useCdn` option set to true,
  // as authenticated requests cannot be cached
  'token' => 'sanity-auth-token',
]);
```

### Specifying API version

Sanity uses ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD) in UTC timezone for versioning. The explanation for this can be found [in the documentation](http://sanity.io/help/api-versioning)

In general, unless you know what API version you want to use, you'll want to set it to todays UTC date. By doing this, you'll get all the latest bugfixes and features, while  preventing any timezone confusion and locking the API to prevent breaking changes.

**Note**: Do not be tempted to use a dynamic value for the `apiVersion`. The whole reason for setting a static value is to prevent unexpected, breaking changes.

In future versions, specifying an API version will be required. For now, to maintain backwards compatiblity, not specifying a version will trigger a deprecation warning and fall back to using `v1`.

### Fetch a single document by ID

```php
$document = $client->getDocument('someDocumentId');
```

### Performing queries

```php
$results = $client->fetch(
  '*[_type == $type][0...3]', // Query
  ['type' => 'product'] // Params (optional)
);

foreach ($product in $results) {
  echo $product['title'] . '\n';
}
```

See the [query documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/front-ends/query-cheat-sheet) for more information on how to write queries.

### Creating documents

```php
$doc = [
  '_type' => 'bike',
  'name'  => 'Bengler Tandem Extraordinaire',
  'seats' => 2,
];

$newDocument = $client->create($doc);
echo 'Bike was created, document ID is ' . $newDocument['_id'];
```

This creates a new document with the given properties. It must contain a `_type` attribute, and _may_ contain a `_id` attribute. If an ID is specified and a document with that ID already exist, the mutation will fail. If an ID is not specified, it will be auto-generated and is included in the returned document.

### Creating a document (if it does not exist)

As noted above, if you include an `_id` property when calling `create()` and a document with this ID already exists, it will fail. If you instead want to ignore the create operation if it exists, you can use `createIfNotExists()`. It takes the same arguments as `create()`, the only difference being that it *requires* an `_id` attribute.

```php
$doc = [
  '_id'   => 'my-document-id',
  '_type' => 'bike',
  'name'  => 'Amazing bike',
  'seats' => 3,
];

$newDocument = $client->createIfNotExists($doc);
```

### Replacing a document

If you don't care whether or not a document exists already and just want to replace it, you can use the `createOrReplace()` method.

```php
$doc = [
  '_id'   => 'my-document-id',
  '_type' => 'bike',
  'name'  => 'Amazing bike',
  'seats' => 3,
];

$newDocument = $client->createOrReplace($doc);
```

### Patch/update a document

```php
use Sanity\Exception\BaseException;

try {
  $updatedBike = $client
    ->patch('bike-123') // Document ID to patch
    ->set(['inStock' => false]) // Shallow merge
    ->inc(['numSold' => 1]) // Increment field by count
    ->commit(); // Perform the patch and return the modified document
} catch (BaseException $error) {
  echo 'Oh no, the update failed: ';
  var_dump($error);
}
```

Todo: Document all patch operations

### Delete a document

```php
use Sanity\Exception\BaseException;

try {
  $client->delete('bike-123');
} catch (BaseException $error) {
  echo 'Delete failed: ';
  var_dump($error);
}
```

### Multiple mutations in a transaction

```php
$namePatch = $client->patch('bike-310')->set(['name' => 'A Bike To Go']);

try {
  $client->transaction()
    ->create(['name' => 'Bengler Tandem Extraordinaire', 'seats' => 2])
    ->delete('bike-123')
    ->patch($namePatch)
    ->commit();

  echo 'A whole lot of stuff just happened!';
} catch (BaseException $error) {
  echo 'Transaction failed:';
  var_dump($error);
}
```

### Clientless patches & transactions

```php
use Sanity\Patch;
use Sanity\Transaction;

// Patches:
$patch = new Patch('<documentId>');
$patch->inc(['count' => 1])->unset(['visits']);
$client->mutate($patch);

// Transactions:
$transaction = new Transaction();
$transaction
  ->create(['_id' => '123', 'name' => 'FooBike'])
  ->delete('someDocId');

$client->mutate($transaction);
```

An important note on this approach is that you cannot call `commit()` on transactions or patches instantiated this way, instead you have to pass them to `client.mutate()`.

### Get client configuration

```php
$config = $client->config();
echo $config['dataset'];
```

### Set client configuration

```php
$client->config(['dataset' => 'newDataset']);
```

The new configuration will be merged with the existing, so you only need to pass the options you want to modify.

### Rendering block content

When you use the block editor in Sanity, it produces a structured array structure that you can use to render the content on any platform you might want. In PHP, a common output format is HTML. To make the transformation from the array structure to HTML simpler, we include a helper class for this within the library.

If your content only contains the basic, built-in block types, you can get rendered HTML like this:

```php
use Sanity\BlockContent;

$document = $client->getDocument('some-doc');
$article = $document['article']; // The field that contains your block content

$html = BlockContent::toHtml($article, [
    'projectId'    => 'abc123',
    'dataset'      => 'bikeshop',
    'imageOptions' => ['w' => 320, 'h' => 240]
]);
```

If you have some custom types, or would like to customize the rendering, you may pass an associative array of serializers:

```php
$html = BlockContent::toHtml($article, [
  'serializers' => [
    'listItem' => function ($item, $parent, $htmlBuilder) {
      return '<li class="my-list-item">' . implode('\n', $item['children']) . '</li>';
    },
    'geopoint' => function ($item) {
      $attrs = $item['attributes']
      $url = 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=someApiKey&center='
      $url .= $attrs['lat'] . ',' . $attrs['lng'];
      return '<iframe class="geomap" src="' . $url . '" allowfullscreen></iframe>'
    },
    'pet' => function ($item, $parent, $htmlBuilder) {
      return '<p class="pet">' . $htmlBuilder->escape($item['attributes']['name']) . '</p>';
    }
  ]
]);
```
